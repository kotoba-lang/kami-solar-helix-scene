  "kami-solar-helix-scene — EDN authoring surface for the solar system's
  so-called \"helical model\": since the Sun itself moves through the
  Galaxy, a planet's path in a frame where the Sun is NOT held fixed (e.g.
  relative to nearby stars or the Galactic Center) is a helix/corkscrew,
  not the flat ellipse seen in the ordinary Sun-fixed heliocentric frame.
  Both descriptions are correct simultaneously — this is a change of
  reference frame (Galilean addition of the Sun's translational velocity
  to each planet's orbital velocity), not a competing physical claim.

  This namespace exists because the popular 2012-era \"vortex\" animations
  of this idea (e.g. DjSadhu's \"The Helical Model\") got the *geometry*
  wrong: they drew a tight corkscrew, when the real ratio of the Sun's
  galactic advance per orbit to the orbit's own circumference is large
  (~7.4x for Earth, see [[pitch-to-circumference-ratio]]) — i.e. the true
  curve is a very gently stretched-out spring, nearly a straight line with
  a small sinusoidal wobble, not a tight vortex tube. Concrete numbers,
  not just the corrected picture, are the point of this repo.

  ## Simplifications (read before consuming positions downstream)

  - **Circular, coplanar orbits.** [[resources/solar-helix.edn]] uses each
    planet's real semi-major axis as a fixed orbital radius and its real
    sidereal period, but ignores eccentricity and each planet's own small
    inclination to the ecliptic. Good enough to illustrate the helix/pitch
    geometry; this is NOT an ephemeris (use VSOP/DE440 for true positions).
  - **Single-axis tilt for the galactic frame.** A real ecliptic->Galactic
    transform needs the solar apex's full spherical coordinates (RA/Dec of
    the Galactic pole and of the direction of solar motion). This
    namespace instead uses one scalar `:ecliptic-tilt-deg` (~60°, the
    commonly cited popular-science rounding for that inclination) and
    rotates the heliocentric orbital plane by that single angle around the
    x-axis before adding the Sun's forward translation — see
    [[galactic-frame-position-au]]. Treat the resulting 3D path as
    illustrative of the *helix shape and pitch*, not as true galactic
    coordinates.
  - **`:sun-speed-km-s` is a rounded CONFIG default (220.0)**, the
    traditional IAU-era Local Standard of Rest circular speed; modern
    Gaia-based fits commonly land ~225-240 km/s depending on the adopted
    R0/rotation curve. Swap the EDN value if a different estimate is
    wanted — nothing here is hardcoded to 220 beyond this one field.

  Zero-dep portable CLJC. Depends only on `kotoba-lang/scene` (tolerant
  EDN accessors: `scene/mget` / `scene/num` / `scene/vec3` / `scene/root-map`
  / `scene/kw-key`), the same way `kami-atmosphere-scene` / `kami-cam-scene`
  parse their EDN authoring surfaces."
